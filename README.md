# Lava Run
mobile game

This is a side scrolling game with mobile gameplay in mind.  The game was developed with the Phaser.io Framework. 

This game is in the early stages of development.  

#Setup
There is a little bit of setting up to do before you are able to run the game.  You will need a local web server if you want to develop on your local machine. There is a great tutorial for this and more on the Phaser website. http://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started
